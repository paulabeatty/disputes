[RE: Your Account Number (if known)]

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to dispute [a] fraudulent charge(s) on my account in the amount(s) of $______, and posted on [dates]. I am a victim of identity theft, and I did not make [this/these] charge(s). I request that you remove the fraudulent charge(s) and any related finance charge and other charges from my account, send me an updated and accurate statement, and close the account (if applicable). I also request that you cease reporting the inaccurate information to all of the nationwide credit reporting agencies (CRAs) to which you provided it.

Enclosed is a copy of my Identity Theft Report supporting my position, and a copy of my credit report showing the fraudulent items related to your company that are the result of identity theft. [Consumers should redact information that is unrelated to the dispute with this company.] Also enclosed is a copy of the Notice to Furnishers issued by the Federal Trade Commission, which details your responsibilities under the Fair Credit Reporting Act as an information furnisher to CRAs. The Notice also specifies your responsibilities when you receive notice from a CRA, under section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, that information you provided to the CRA may be the result of identity theft. Those responsibilities include ceasing to provide the inaccurate information to any CRAs, and ensuring that you do not attempt to sell or transfer the fraudulent debts to another party for collection.

Please investigate this matter and send me a written explanation of your findings and actions.


Sincerely,
[Your Name]
